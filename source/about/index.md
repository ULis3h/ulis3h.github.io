# About Me

I’m a software engineer focused on building reliable systems, uncovering security vulnerabilities, and developing UAV platforms. I enjoy bridging software craftsmanship with practical security research and hands‑on hardware.

Focus areas:

- Software Development — Full‑stack engineering, performance tuning, and clean architecture.
- Vulnerability Research — Reverse engineering, fuzzing, PoCs, and mitigation strategies.
- UAV Development — Flight control, telemetry, embedded firmware, and field testing.

I value clarity, robustness, and thoughtful design, and I’m always keen to learn, ship, and iterate.
